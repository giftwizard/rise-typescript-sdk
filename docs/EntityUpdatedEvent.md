# EntityUpdatedEvent



## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**currentEntityAsJson** | **string** | Since platformized APIs only expose PATCH and not PUT we can\&#39;t assume that the fields sent from the client are the actual diff. This means that to generate a list of changed fields (as opposed to sent fields) one needs to traverse both objects. We don\&#39;t want to impose this on all developers and so we leave this traversal to the notification recipients which need it. | [optional] [default to undefined]

## Example

```typescript
import { EntityUpdatedEvent } from 'rise-typescript-sdk';

const instance: EntityUpdatedEvent = {
    currentEntityAsJson,
};
```
